Compile using the command:
	make

Run using the command:
    ./crawler web_url [-domain domain] [-threads num_of_threads] [-count top_word_count] [-miss top_miss_count]

NOTE:
    The -domain (domain), -threads (num_of_threads), -count (top_word_count), and -miss (top_miss_count)
     options are not required, however when not included the program defaults to single threaded, domain defaults to web_url,
    and outputs the top 500 words found and the top 100 missed words.
    The web_url is required and must include a valid URL to begin the analysis.
    The output of the file can be found in the directory which the program was ran under the name
    of outHTML.html. This html document includes number of links found, number of websites visited,
    top misspelled words, most used words, and (if it is an Amazon page) includes information about the products
    found and the users who reviewed them. The documenments are separated by their titles as large captions,
    the data is provided in neat HTML tables.
    
    Please specify a domain when running this program!
